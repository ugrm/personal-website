Hi! I'm Jeahn Han, a senior at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), currently interning at [MPIL](https://mpil-gist.github.io/).

My research interests are in robotics and sensor-driven perception. Currently, I'm working on geometry-based floorplan localization. Long-term, I'm excited to integrate acoustic and olfactory sensors into robotics to significantly enhance perception
